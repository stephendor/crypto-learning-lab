## üéØ Mission

This repository documents my 12-month journey from pure mathematics into applied cryptography, emphasizing:
- **Theory to Practice**: Every mathematical concept implemented in Rust
- **Formal Verification**: Critical implementations proven correct in Lean 4
- **Security Awareness**: Constant-time algorithms and side-channel resistance
- **Educational Value**: Clear explanations linking math, code, and proofs

## üìö Learning Path

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Foundations
- [x] Rust fundamentals and ownership model
- [ ] Classical cryptography implementations
- [ ] CryptoPals challenges (Sets 1-2)
- [ ] Basic Lean proofs for number theory


## ü§ù Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, contributions are welcome:

- **Bug Reports**: If you find errors in implementations
- **Educational Improvements**: Better explanations or visualizations
- **Additional Examples**: More ways to demonstrate concepts
- **Lean Proofs**: Help with formal verification challenges

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
